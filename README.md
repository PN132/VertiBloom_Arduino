Description: This Arduino program is used to control the time intervals in which the plant is pollinated. The time intervals and days can be customized by the user, 
and afterwards the program runs on its own. The local time is printed every second, and the checkStatus() class is called to check if the plant should be pollinated
or not. Two output pins wire to an indicator LED for troubleshooting, and the power source of the shaker electronic components.
